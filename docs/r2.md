# R2

## What is it?

[R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) is Cloudflare's blob storage provider.
We use it to store all of the release assets stored by the Release Worker.

## Noteworthy points

### Directories

R2 stores files flatly, meaning a directory does not exist in R2.

However, R2 allows characters such as slashes (/) in an object's name.
For directories we can then specify a prefix (like `nodejs/release/`) and R2 will only return objects that has a name that starts with that prefix.

### Bindings API

R2 allows integration with Workers through their [bindings API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/workers-api-usage/).
We use this when fetching files.

### S3 API

Due to some performance issues we were seeing with R2's `list` binding command, we opted to use R2's S3 API for listing directories.

### Buckets

We have two R2 buckets:

- `dist-staging` - Holds staged releases. This bucket is private and should not be publicly accessible.

- `dist-prod` - Holds released versions of Node.js. Everything in this bucket should be considered publicly accessible.

(see [Release Process](./release-process.md) for more information on how we use these buckets)
